    Hey! My name is Christina Chon and this is my website.<br><br>
    I'm looking forward to learning more about web and software development. I'm originally from California and moved to Seattle about 10 years ago (wow, time flies!) I attended school at University of California, Riverside and recieved my Bachelor's of Arts in Psychology. <br><br>
    My past job experience is working with children in the childcare setting and as a behavior therapist. Currently, I am working within University Recruiting with Microsoft and seeing all the new college graduates starting their journey in the workforce. Seeing all the new Software Engineers encouraged me to take a chance and learn how to code. It was something that always looked interesting and if they can do it, why can't I?<br><br>
    My other hobbies that I enjoy are indoor bouldering, playing video games (Witcher 3 and Zelda BOTW are my current favorites!), and acting. I have one small dog that I love to play with and take on walks around the neighborhood or take to the park.
